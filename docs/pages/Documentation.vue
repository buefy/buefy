            Buefy (pronounced /ˈbyo͞oˌfī/, like <b>beau-fy</b>) is a user interface component library made on top
            of two <em>fresh</em> but very well known frameworks, being them
            <a href="https://vuejs.org" target="_blank">Vuejs</a> and <a href="https://bulma.io/">Bulma</a>.
            Buefy has two core principles: 1. keep stuff simple and 2. be lightweight.
        </p>

        <p>
            We like to think that Buefy is the javascript layer for your Bulma interface, since it doesn't require for it to be
            a sophisticated Single-Page Application.
            You can import it on a ordinary webpage and use Vuejs as a replacement for jQuery —
            as you can see in this
            <a href="https://codepen.io/anon/pen/RBWMXE?editors=1010" target="_blank">Codepen</a>
            or any other example over the documentation.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            This documentation assumes you know the basic of Vuejs, if you're not confortable yet with it,
            it's probably not the best idea to learn from here as your first step — learn the basics then come back.
            <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide" target="_blank">Vue.js</a> website is the greatest source for you to start with.
        </blockquote>

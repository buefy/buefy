# Raising an Issue

* Make sure the issue hasn't been raised yet
* Include **screenshots** or animated GIFs in your issue whenever needed (if visual issue)

# Submitting a Pull Request

* The ``master`` branch is a snapshot of the latest stable release. **Submit your PR in the ``dev`` branch**
* Include **screenshots** or animated GIFs in your pull request whenever needed (if visual changes)
* It's OK to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR - we will let GitHub automatically squash it before merging
* **DO NOT** commit the ``lib`` and ``dist`` folder, use it only for testing on your end
* If adding new feature:
    * Provide convincing reason to add this feature. Ideally you should open a suggestion issue first and have it greenlighted before working on it

## Buefy Javascript styleguide

* Follow the rules in ``.eslintrc.js``, general:
    * **Use camelCase**
    * **No semi-colons** ``;``
    * **4 spaces indentation**
    * Use only ``const`` or ``let``
    * **No trailing space**
    * End files with a **new line**
* Keep lines with 120 characters or less
* Add a comment block before every **method**, **watcher** and **computed property** explaining what it does â€” use the **imperative mood** ("Calculate this..." not "Calculates this...") with this template:
```javascript
/**
 * Calculate if the dropdown is horizontally visible when activated,
 * otherwise it is opened left sided.
 */
```
* Add one-line comment inside any block whenever you judge necessary
* Order Vue instance by:
    * name
    * mixins
    * components
    * props
    * data properties
    * computed properties
    * watchers
    * methods
    * directives
    * filters
    * lifecycle hooks
        * beforeCreate
        * created
        * beforeMount
        * mounted
        * beforeDestroy
        * destroyed

## Buefy Sass styleguide

* **Always on a separated file** in ``/src/scss/components``
* **Use .scss extension**
* **Use kebab-case**
* Use only **classes**
* Use only **double quotes** ``"``
* Use only **rem** or **em** for ``padding``, ``margin`` and ``font-size``
* **No trailing space**
* End files with a **new line**
* Order the CSS rule by:
    * direct styles
    * nested tags
    * pseudo-classes
    * modifiers
    * responsive styles

Sass example:
```scss
.element {
    // Direct styles
    @extend .something;
    @include mixin;
    property: value;
    // Nested tags
    span {
        // ...
    }
    .child {
        // ...
    }
    // Pseudo-classes
    &:before {
        // ...
    }
    // Modifiers
    &.is-active {
        // ...
    }
    &.has-icon {
        // ...
    }
    // Responsive styles
    @include mobile {
        // ...
    }
    @include tablet {
        // ...
    }
}
```
